        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent and has become popular worldwide. It is typically made by layering fragrant basmati rice with marinated meat (chicken, mutton, fish, or beef) or vegetables, along with spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and saffron. Often cooked with yogurt, onions, and herbs, the dish is slow-cooked to allow the flavors to meld beautifully. Regional variations like Hyderabadi, Kolkata, and Lucknowi biryani add unique touches, incorporating local ingredients and cooking techniques. Biryani is often served with raita, boiled eggs, or salad.</p>
